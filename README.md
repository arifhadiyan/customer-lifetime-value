**Background**

Customer lifetime value, or CLV, is a measure of how important a customer is to a company. From this value, a company can determine the profit gained from a customer and the costs incurred to acquire new customers or retain existing ones. This figure is quite important for a company if it wants to effectively understand the total profit (value) that can be obtained from maintaining a business relationship with a customer over their entire lifetime.

In the case of an insurance company, knowing the CLV can help improve several aspects of the company's performance, including the following:

* Marketing can use CLV information to identify customers who are likely to make fewer claims and pay higher premiums. Marketing can then focus on customers who generate significant profits for the company.
* Customer service can determine the appropriate methods to handle each customer, ensuring that high costs are not incurred for customers with a low CLV.
* Risk management can calculate how a customer can provide profit and the steps needed when that customer decides to leave.

**Problem Statement**

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) can be calculated based on two pieces of information: Customer Value (the average value of a customer) and Average Customer Lifespan (the average duration of a customer's business relationship with the company). These two pieces of information are quite limited and do not provide a detailed picture of customer characteristics. Therefore, although a CLV value can be obtained, this information cannot be widely used. Additionally, manually calculating the CLV value for a company with a diverse range of customers with varying characteristics takes a considerable amount of time.

By predicting Customer Lifetime Value, a company can determine which customers are likely to have a high value and which are not. The company can then focus its marketing efforts on high-value customers rather than low-value customers. This can increase the company's efficiency. Therefore, the company needs a fast and accurate method to understand and predict the CLV of customers based on the available data.

**Goals**

Based on the problem statement, the company needs a tool that can predict and help determine the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) of their customers accurately based on certain features. Differences in various customer data, such as vehicle type, income level, and education level, can enhance the accuracy of these customer value predictions.

**Analytic Approach**

An analytic approach needs to be undertaken to analyze data and identify patterns in customer characteristics that influence the resulting CLV.

We will build a machine learning regression model that will help the insurance company provide a CLV prediction tool. This tool will significantly assist the company in accelerating the planning and implementation processes related to customers (including marketing, relationship building, prioritization, etc.), thereby maximizing the company's profits.

**Metric Evaluation**

The Metric Evaluation that will be used is as follows:
* RMSE is the root mean square error.
* MAE is the mean absolute error.
* MAPE is the mean absolute percentage error generated by the regression model.

Smaller values of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE indicate that the model is more accurate in predicting CLV.

Additionally, we can use R-squared or adj. R-squared if the selected model is a linear model. R-squared is used to determine how well the model represents the variance in the overall data. A value closer to 1 indicates a better fit of the model to the observed data. However, this metric is not valid for non-linear models.

**Features Information**

| **Feature** | **Data Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vehicle Class | Object | Class of Customer Vehicle |
| Coverage | Object | Type of Insurance Policies |
| Renew Offer Type | Object | Type of Renewal Offers |
| Employment Status | Object | Customer Employment Status |
| Marital Status | Object | Customer Marital Status |
| Education | Object | Customer Education Level |
| Number of Policies | Float | Number of Policies Customer Currently Owns |
| Monthly Premium Auto | Float | Amount of customers' monthly insurance payments (in US$)|
| Total Claim Amount | Float | Cumulative Amount of Claims Since Policy Inception|
| Income | Float | Customer Income (in US$)|
| Customer Lifetime Value | Float | Customer Lifetime Value |

Based on the modeling conducted, the feature 'Number of Policies' emerges as the most influential factor affecting 'Customer Lifetime Value' (CLV).

The evaluation metric used for the model is MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error). With a MAPE value of 4.55% obtained after hyperparameter tuning, we can infer that if this model were used to estimate CLV for new customers at company A within the trained range of values (obtained from df.describe(include='all') function), the estimated CLV would on average deviate by approximately 4.55% from the actual CLV values. 

However, there's a possibility that predictions could deviate further due to the bias still evident in the model, as seen from the visualization comparing actual CLV and predictions. This bias stems from the limited features in the dataset that can represent various aspects of customer information, such as vehicle class, insurance type, employment status, marital status, education level, and others.
